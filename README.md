# Convolutional Kernel Density Estimation (CKDE)

## üìÑ Description
The Convolutional Kernel Density Estimation (CKDE) is a method that transforms EEG signals into images and applies a convolution filter to improve the visualization and automatic detection of pathological events such as interictal epileptic spikes (IESs). More details can be found in published scientific paper [[L. Gardy et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.5220/0008877601010109)] and in [[doctoral thesis of L. Gardy](http://thesesups.ups-tlse.fr/5164/1/2021TOU30190.pdf)].

With a time series as input, the algorithm performs the following steps:
- Transforms the timeseries into an image
- Convolves this image
- [Optional] Filters the convolved image to isolate epileptic spikes

User can then apply filters, like a low-pass filter, to isolate low density events, such as IEDs.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11
- Python libraries
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üìù Usage
```python
### Get a timeseries filepath (look in the folder you have downloaded)
timeseries_folderpath = r"input_data\events_signal_data"
timeserie_filename = f"event_{event_num}.txt"

### Load a timeseries from the sample data provided with this program (1D)
signal = load_timeseries(timeseries_folderpath, timeserie_filename) # or,
#signal = random_signal_simulation()

### Get the timeseries info
meta_data = json.load(open(r"input_data\events_info.json"))
sfreq = meta_data["events_info"][event_num]["sampling_frequency"]

### Convert it to a 2D signal
image_2D = from_1D_to_2D(signal, bandwidth = 1)

### Convolve the 2D signal
image_2D_convolved = convolve_2D_image(image_2D, convolution = "gaussian custom")

### Plot result
fig_name = "Epileptic spike (signal duration: 400 ms) \n\n[1] raw [2] imaged [3] convoluted"
plot_result(signal, image_2D, image_2D_convolved, fig_name)
```

```sh
python main.py  # Runs the script
```

### Input data
We propose some simulated data to validate our procedure with a known frequency, duration and position. This database is structured as shown in figure 1. User can either use these data, use his own, or simulate some. A signal simulation function is also provided in the program.

### Methods
Figure 2 shows how the convolved image (2D) is drawn from the raw signal (1D). A: Convolution process. B: Full process.

### Results
Figure 3 shows the result of the full process. The timeseries used as input is an IED called "event_5" in the data sample we provide with this program.

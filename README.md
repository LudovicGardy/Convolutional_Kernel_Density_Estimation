# Convolutional Kernel Density Estimation (CKDE)

## Description

This program presents convolutional kernel density estimation, a method used to detect intercritical epilpetic spikes (IEDs) in [Gardy et al., 2019].

The user provides a time series as input. The algorithm will perform the following steps:
- Transform the timeseries into an image
- Convolve this image

The user can then apply filters, like a low-pass filter, to isolate low density events, such as IEDs.

Please, open _**`main.py`**_ and change the path inside to use the program.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11
- Python libraries: see requirements.txt

### Instructions

Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd Custom_colormaps
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
### Get a timeseries filepath (look in the folder you have downloaded)
timeseries_folderpath = r"test_events_database\events_signal_data"
timeserie_filename = f"event_{event_num}.txt"

### Load a timeseries from the sample data provided with this program (1D)
signal = load_timeseries(timeseries_folderpath, timeserie_filename) # or,
#signal = random_signal_simulation()

### Get the timeseries info
json_dict = json.load(open(r"test_events_database\events_info.json"))
sfreq = json_dict["events_info"][event_num]["sampling_frequency"]

### Convert it to a 2D signal
image_2D = from_1D_to_2D(signal, bandwidth = 1)

### Convolve the 2D signal
image_2D_convolved = convolve_2D_image(image_2D, convolution = "gaussian custom")

### Plot result
fig_name = "Epileptic spike (signal duration: 400 ms) \n\n[1] raw [2] imaged [3] convoluted"
plot_result(signal, image_2D, image_2D_convolved, fig_name)
```

## Data

We propose some simulated data to validate our procedure with a known frequency, duration and position. This database is structured as shown in figure 1. User can either use these data, use his own, or simulate some. A signal simulation function is also provided in the program.

## Methods

Figure 2 shows how the convolved image (2D) is drawn from the raw signal (1D). A: Convolution process. B: Full process.

## Results

Figure 3 shows the result of the full process. The timeseries used as input is an IED called "event_5" in the data sample we provide with this program.

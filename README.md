# Description
This program presents convolutional kernel density estimation, a method used to detect intercritical epilpetic spikes (IEDs) in [Gardy et al., 2019].

The user provides a time series as input. The algorithm will perform the following steps:
- Transform the timeseries into an image
- Convolve this image

The user can then apply filters, like a low-pass filter, to isolate low density events, such as IEDs.

Please, open _**`main.py`**_ and change the path inside to use the program.

# Procedure example (main.py)
```
### User should change these information in the script (main.py).

root = r"~/CKDE"
event_num = 5
```

# Some information about the dataset
We propose some simulated data to validate our procedure with a known frequency, duration and position. This database is structured as shown in figure 1. User can either use these data, use his own, or simulate some. A signal simulation function is also provided in the program.

# Methods
Figure 2 shows how the convolved image (2D) is drawn from the raw signal (1D). A: Convolution process. B: Full process.

# Results
Figure 3 shows the result of the full process. The timeseries used as input is an IED called "event_5" in the data sample we provide with this program.
